/**
 * Run on local disk, sync to the real output directory at the end.
 *
 * The output root is commonly a shared sshfs mount. Measured on this setup:
 * 4.61 MB/s write, 2.45 MB/s read, against 1158/7936 MB/s on local disk. The
 * pipeline writes and re-reads its intermediates constantly — one 26-part
 * assault_buggy run moved 3.3 GB of per-part STL alone, which cost ~36 of its
 * 52.7 compute minutes purely in transfer.
 *
 * `render/parts_split.ts` already keeps the biggest offender (the context
 * render's throwaway meshes) local. This does the same for EVERYTHING: the run
 * writes to a local staging dir and the results are synced once, in bulk, at the
 * end. Bulk transfer is also where sshfs is least bad — one large sequential
 * copy instead of thousands of small scattered writes.
 *
 * The sync runs on failure too. A crashed run's artifacts are how you find out
 * WHY it crashed, so losing them to a local temp dir would be worse than the
 * slow writes this exists to avoid.
