/**
 * Wall-clock accounting per pipeline stage.
 *
 * A run's cost is dominated by OpenSCAD and Blender, not by the LLM, and the
 * only way to know which stage to attack is to measure them separately. This is
 * a process-global accumulator rather than a threaded-through parameter so a
 * call site deep in the render or compile path can be timed without changing
 * every signature between it and the pipeline entry point.
 *
 * Stages nest: `draft.split` is inside `draft.loop`, so the totals deliberately
 * OVERLAP and must not be summed. `report()` prints children indented under
 * their parent and leaves the arithmetic to the reader.
